  "Well, vaccines might've blinded your children, but it turns out, Mother was right after all! Masturbating will make you go blind, at least to your own self-loathing for sixty seconds. And if you take enough of those Mollis pills, you can go blind forever! Speaking of blindness, here's another sensory overload. Smell... I just read this online. Did you know that you can defecate in a jar, ferment it for two weeks in the sun, and then get high off the vapors?",
  "As the global population continues to grow, the demand for resources such as food, water, and energy is increasing at an unprecedented rate, posing significant challenges to sustainability, environmental conservation, and equitable distribution, which requires innovative solutions that prioritize long-term resilience and address the needs of vulnerable populations around the world. Excuse me!  This is a supermarket!  You two need to get a room! No, we don't. Renegade!",
  "What a guy! Ahh! Anyway, he thinks its not true. Thinks I'm paranoid. But he's wrong. And that's the thing. Smart people, the most brilliant people, like Philip Trevor, whatever, they don't get it. They don't get it and that's the point. Big science and big pharma, that's how the whole house of cards works. They've tricked the clever people into actually believing their nonsense! It's the genius of the thing - get the clever and the stupid will follow...",
  "What causes baldness? Don't take this the wrong way, but the explanation may be downstairs. It's bald, and it wants you to be, too. Through a partially scientific study, doctors have determined that an abundance of testosterone causes baldness. And let's be honest- who needs testosterone? Now science brings you Castrodone. Castrodone goes to the glands that produce testosterone, and kills them, protecting your hair and saving your sex life... within a few days.",

  "Exactly! South America! When I was growing up, people in the south of America spoke English! But that goes to show you - it's about the dark antimatter of money, and how the banks and politicians have been corrupted by the Illuminati in a totally different way to the way you imagined. Red alert, people. Banks aren't just about lending you money so you are a slave to the system, they actually, huhu, enslave you by capturing your DNA at the very moment you open your account.",
  "Hear. Open your ears! Seriously! I heard there's a government facility somewhere in Blaine County that's developing a nerve toxin so powerful, a single drop could turn the West Coast into a bunch of vapid asswipes who stare at the sun and have forgotten how to read. N-No wait... That's th- hehe, that's my little old joke. Stay on your toes, people, because someone is out there to get you, and you're probably paying for the privilege! Until next time, I guess.",
  "Let's be honest about things for a second- really honest. You came out to the west coast to get away from something. Everyone does. Let's face it- the Midwest is full of retards!

  "Someone's breaking into your home. What do you do? Call 911? It takes the police an average of 35 minutes to respond to a 911 call.

Do it- the patriotic way. That's right! Ammunation has all the equipment you need to protect your family from the evils of a liberal society!",
